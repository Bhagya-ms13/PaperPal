# Description:<br />
This project is a tool that serves as both a research paper recommendation system and a text summarization tool. It offers a streamlined interface for users to interact with. The research paper recommendationfeature allows users to input a research paper's name and receive recommendations for similar papers. This is achieved using a precomputed similarity matrix and a straightforward recommendation algorithm.

Additionally, the tool offers a text summarization feature for PDF files. Users can upload a PDF file, and the tool will extract text from the PDF, split it into sections based on headings, and summarize each section using the LsaSummarizer algorithm. This feature is useful for quickly getting an overview of the content of a lengthy document.<br />

Overall, this project provides a convenient and efficient way for users to explore research papers and summarize text, making it a valuable tool for researchers, students, and anyone dealing with large amounts of textual data.
